# File Signer and Verifier (Java)

This Java application allows you to digitally **sign** and **verify** files using RSA encryption. It operates with a local keystore (`.jks`) for key management, and Base64 encoding for signature output.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to compile and run the application:

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.

3. Compile the following files:
   - `Signador.java`
   - `Validador.java`

4. Make sure the `key.jks` file is in the root directory of the project.

## Usage

### Signing Files

Run the `Signador` program to sign files in a folder:

```bash
java Signador
You will be prompted to enter the path to a folder.

The program will read all files and generate a Base64-encoded digital signature for each.

After signing, you can choose whether to sign more files.

Verifying a Signature
Run the Validador program to verify the integrity of a file:

bash
Copiar
Editar
java Validador
Enter the path to the file you want to verify.

Enter the Base64-encoded signature.

The program will validate it using the public key stored in the keystore.

Keystore Details
File: key.jks

Alias: fitxers

Password: password

To generate your own keystore:

bash
Copiar
Editar
keytool -genkeypair -alias fitxers -keyalg RSA -keystore key.jks -storepass password
Requirements
Java 8 or higher

key.jks keystore file in the project root directory

Notes
The key.jks file is expected to be Base64-encoded and will be decoded before loading.

The project uses SHA256withRSA as the signature algorithm.

Both signing and verification are done using native Java KeyStore, Signature, and Base64 libraries.
